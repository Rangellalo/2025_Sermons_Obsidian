# Faithfulness in Marriage—A Foundation for Church Stability

**Scripture:**  
Hebrews 13:4; Ephesians 5:31–33

---

## Introduction

Faithfulness in marriage is the backbone of a strong family and a stable church. In a culture that often devalues marriage, God’s people are called to uphold and model His design—a covenant love that mirrors Christ’s love for His bride.

> **Humorous Illustration:**  
> A young boy asked his dad, “Dad, how much does it cost to get married?” The father replied, “Son, I’m not sure—I’m still paying for it!”  
> *Transition:* The cost of a faithful, Christ-honoring marriage is not counted in dollars, but in daily acts of love, sacrifice, and commitment.

## I. *Marriage Is Honorable Before God* (**Hebrews 13:4**)

**A. God’s Design for Marriage**  
   1. **Scripture:**  
      “Marriage is to be held in honor among all, and the marriage bed is to be undefiled; for fornicators and adulterers God will judge.” (Hebrews 13:4)  
      “So God created man in his own image… male and female he created them.” (Genesis 1:27)  
      “Therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and they shall become one flesh.” (Genesis 2:24)
   2. Marriage is not a human invention but a divine institution, created and blessed by God from the beginning.
   3. The word “honor” (τίμιος, *timios*) means “precious” or “of great value”—the same word used for precious metals and the blood of Christ (1 Pet 1:19).  
      - Marriage is to be treasured as a sacred covenant, not a mere social contract.  
      - God calls every believer to prize, esteem, and protect marriage as one of His most valuable gifts to humanity.  
      - [See Special Note: The Preciousness of Marriage](#the-preciousness-of-marriage-more-than-a-social-contract)

> **Humorous Illustration:**  
> Someone said, “Marriage is like a deck of cards. In the beginning, all you need is two hearts and a diamond. By the end, you’re looking for a club and a spade!”  
> *Transition:* But God’s design is for us to hold onto those hearts and diamonds for life.

**B. Honoring the Marriage Covenant**  
   1. To honor marriage means to treat it as precious, valuable, and worthy of protection.
   2. The marriage bed is to be kept pure—faithfulness is required physically, emotionally, and spiritually.  
      - **Physical faithfulness:** “The marriage bed is to be undefiled” (Hebrews 13:4; 1 Corinthians 7:2–5).  
      - **Emotional faithfulness:** Marriage is a “one flesh” union that involves deep emotional connection and loyalty (Ephesians 5:28–29; Proverbs 5:18–19; 1 Peter 3:7).  
        - Husbands are to “nourish and cherish” their wives (Ephesians 5:29).  
        - “Live with your wives in an understanding way, showing honor” (1 Peter 3:7).  
        - “Rejoice in the wife of your youth… be intoxicated always in her love” (Proverbs 5:18–19).  
        - “Love is patient and kind… not irritable or resentful” (1 Corinthians 13:4–7).  
      - **Spiritual faithfulness:** Marriage reflects Christ’s union with the church (Ephesians 5:31–32).  
      - [See Special Note: Emotional Faithfulness](#emotional-faithfulness-is-just-as-essential)

**C. Application**  
   1. Christians are called to uphold the sanctity of marriage in their lives and in the church.
   2. Faithfulness in marriage brings stability to the family and the congregation.

## II. *The Mystery of Oneness* (**Ephesians 5:31–32**)

**A. The “One Flesh” Union**  
   1. **Scripture:**  
      “For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and shall be joined to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh.” (Ephesians 5:31; Genesis 2:24)
   2. **“For this reason” explained:**  
      - This phrase points back to God’s creation of woman from man (Genesis 2:23). Adam recognized Eve as “bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh,” and God declared that this unique bond would become the foundation for marriage.  
      - God’s design is that marriage forms a new, primary allegiance—stronger even than the bond between parent and child. The reason for marriage is rooted in God’s intent that man and woman complement and complete each other in a union no other relationship can match.  
      - [See Special Note: The “One Flesh” Union](#the-one-flesh-union)
   3. The language of “leave” (καταλείψει, *kataleipsei*) and “be joined” (προσκολληθήσεται, *proskollēthēsetai*) describes a decisive, lifelong union—a “gluing together” that supersedes all previous relationships.
   4. The “one flesh” union encompasses not only physical intimacy but also the blending of lives, purposes, and destinies.  
      - This union is the deepest possible human relationship, involving the sharing of bodies, hearts, minds, and spiritual lives.
   5. **Connection to Christ and the Church:**  
      - Paul reveals that this original design is a “profound mystery” (v.32)—marriage is a living parable of Christ’s union with His church.  
      - Just as a husband leaves his parents to unite with his wife, Christ left heaven to unite Himself with His bride, the church.  
      - The “one flesh” union is not only about personal fulfillment, but about displaying the gospel to the world by reflecting Christ’s sacrificial, covenantal love.

> **Humorous Illustration:**  
> A wife said, “When the Bible says the two become one, I just wish it had told us which one!”  
> *Transition:* God’s plan is for both to become something new together—united in Christ.

**B. A Picture of Christ and the Church**  
   1. Paul reveals that marriage is a “profound mystery”—a truth previously hidden but now revealed: marriage is a living parable of Christ’s union with His church (Ephesians 5:32).
   2. Just as the husband and wife become “one flesh,” so Christ and the church are united in a spiritual, covenantal bond.
   3. This typology is rooted in God’s eternal plan (Ephesians 3:3–6), where the first marriage in Genesis prefigures the ultimate marriage of Christ and His redeemed people (Revelation 19:7–9).

**C. Application**  
   1. Husbands and wives are called to reflect Christ’s love and the church’s devotion in their marriage.
   2. Oneness is not just about physical intimacy but about unity of purpose, love, and faith.
   3. When couples share God’s grace and presence together, God molds them into “one flesh” in a way that only He can accomplish.  
      - This spiritual union is not automatic; it requires a posture of surrender, a willing and voluntary heart, and a desire to be molded by God—not obstinance or self-will (Ephesians 5:21; Philippians 2:2–5).
      - “Submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God” (Ephesians 5:21) shows that mutual submission and humility are essential for God’s work of unity.
      - Only when both spouses yield themselves to God and to each other can the Spirit truly “glue” them together—blending not just their bodies, but their minds, emotions, and spirits into a new, God-wrought oneness.

## III. *Faithfulness as a Witness to the World*

**A. The Power of Example**  
   1. In a culture of broken promises, faithful marriages stand out as a testimony to God’s faithfulness.
   2. The world sees in Christian marriages a living picture of Christ’s unbreakable covenant with His people (John 13:34–35).
   3. Children, neighbors, and the broader community learn about Christ’s love by watching Christian marriages—how spouses forgive, serve, and remain steadfast.

**B. The Church’s Witness**  
   1. When marriages are strong, the church’s witness is strong. Marital faithfulness upholds the credibility and integrity of the gospel message (Ephesians 5:3–5; Colossians 3:5).
   2. The purity and unity of Christian homes serve as a silent sermon, demonstrating the transforming power of the gospel.

**C. Application**  
   1. Let your marriage be a silent sermon—demonstrate forgiveness, patience, and commitment. Be quick to reconcile, slow to anger, and steadfast in love (1 Corinthians 13:4–7).
   2. Encourage and pray for other couples in the church, knowing that the health of the church is built on the health of its families.

> **Humorous Illustration:**  
> A couple celebrating their 50th anniversary was asked, “What’s the secret to a long marriage?” The husband replied, “Well, we take time to go to a restaurant twice a week. She goes Tuesdays, I go Fridays!”  
> *Transition:* While laughter helps, it’s faithfulness and forgiveness that truly keep a marriage strong.

## IV. *Strengthening Marriages, Strengthening the Church*

**A. Building Up Marriages**  
   1. Invest in your marriage: pray together, study the Bible, and communicate openly.
   2. Seek support when needed—counseling, mentoring, and accountability are signs of strength, not weakness (Proverbs 11:14).

**B. The Church’s Role**  
   1. The church should provide resources, teaching, and encouragement for couples.
   2. Older couples can mentor younger ones, sharing wisdom and encouragement (Titus 2:3–5).
   3. The community’s high regard for marriage supports faithfulness and helps couples remain steadfast in their vows.

**C. The Result**  
   1. As marriages are strengthened, the entire church becomes more stable, loving, and effective in ministry.
   2. The unity and purity of the home overflow into the unity and purity of the church.

## Conclusion

Let’s honor marriage and keep it pure, for the sake of our families and our church. God’s design for marriage is good, and when we live it out, we bless not only ourselves but the whole body of Christ.

---

## Takeaway

Renew your commitment to faithfulness today. Whether you are married, single, or widowed, honor God’s design for marriage in your life and encourage others to do the same. Faithful marriages build a faithful church, and together, we proclaim the gospel of Christ’s love to the world.

## Special Notes

### The Preciousness of Marriage: More Than a Social Contract
The word translated “honor” in Hebrews 13:4—τίμιος (timios)—is not a casual compliment. In the New Testament, this word is reserved for things of the highest value: precious metals (1 Corinthians 3:12), costly stones (Revelation 21:19), and above all, the “precious blood of Christ” (1 Peter 1:19). By using this term, the Holy Spirit is telling us that marriage is not just a human tradition or a legal arrangement; it is a treasure of inestimable worth in the eyes of God.  
When the text says, “Marriage is to be held in honor among all,” it means that every Christian—married or single, young or old—is called to prize, esteem, and protect marriage as one of God’s most valuable gifts to humanity. This is not a value invented by culture, but a truth rooted in creation itself: “From the beginning of creation, ‘God made them male and female.’ For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh” (Genesis 2:24; Mark 10:6-8).

### Emotional Faithfulness is Just as Essential
The “one flesh” union is not only about bodies, but about the sharing of hearts, minds, and lives. Scripture describes marriage as a relationship of deep emotional connection, care, and mutual cherishing:  
- “Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her… nourishing and cherishing her as his own body” (Ephesians 5:25, 29).  
- “Live with your wives in an understanding way, showing honor…” (1 Peter 3:7).  
- “Rejoice in the wife of your youth… let her breasts fill you at all times with delight; be intoxicated always in her love” (Proverbs 5:18–19).  
- “Love is patient and kind… it is not irritable or resentful” (1 Corinthians 13:4–7).

### The “One Flesh” Union
“For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and shall be joined to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh.”  
- The phrase “for this reason” (or “because of this”) is a direct reference to the creation of woman from man (Genesis 2:23). Adam sees Eve and declares, “This at last is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh.” God then announces that this unique bond—unlike any other human relationship—becomes the foundation for marriage.  
- The reason is rooted in the way God created man and woman to complement and complete each other. Marriage is not a human invention, but a divine design that unites two into one new family unit, superseding even the strong bond between parent and child.  
- “Leaving” (καταλείψει, kataleipsei) and “being joined” (προσκολληθήσεται, proskollēthēsetai) describe a decisive, lifelong commitment—a “gluing together” that forms a new primary allegiance. This union is not merely physical but involves the whole person: body, mind, and spirit.  
- The “one flesh” union is the deepest possible human relationship, encompassing physical intimacy, shared life, purpose, and destiny. It is a total blending of lives, not just cohabitation or partnership.  
- Paul reveals that this original design points beyond itself: “This mystery is great, but I am speaking with reference to Christ and the church” (Ephesians 5:32).  
- Just as a husband leaves his parents to unite with his wife, so Christ left His heavenly glory to unite Himself with His bride, the church. The marriage bond is a living picture of the greater spiritual reality of Christ’s sacrificial, covenantal love for His people.
