# The Armor of God: Standing Firm in Spiritual Battle

**Ephesians 6:10–18**  
_Preacher Ed Rangel_

## Thesis Statement

Victory in the Christian life requires spiritual strength, complete dependence on God's Word, and full readiness through His armor. Believers are not called to retreat, but to stand firm in the face of spiritual warfare.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the spiritual reality and urgency of Christian warfare
    
- Identify the true nature of our enemy and the structure of his attacks
    
- Examine the meaning and role of each piece of the armor of God
    
- Apply practical strategies for standing firm in truth, faith, and prayer
    
- Reinforce daily spiritual habits for victory and endurance
    

## Introduction: The Urgency of the Battle

Paul closes his letter to the Ephesians not with sentiment but with strategy. He issues a final charge to the saints—a call to prepare for spiritual conflict. This isn’t a theoretical battle. It’s real. It’s personal. And only those in Christ are called to fight it.

If we neglect this charge, we leave ourselves exposed. If we obey it, we’re equipped to stand firm—grounded in truth, secure in salvation, and ready to resist the devil.

> “Finally, be strong in the Lord and in the strength of His might.” — Ephesians 6:10

**Illustration:** A soldier in uniform but with no armor is no more ready for battle than a Christian with no truth, no righteousness, no preparation, and no prayer. He may look the part—but he’s vulnerable the moment the enemy strikes.

## I. The Charge to the Christian Soldier

### A. Be Strong in the Lord

> “It is God who arms me with strength and keeps my way secure.” — Psalm 18:32  
> “He gives strength to the weary... those who wait for the Lord will gain new strength...” — Isaiah 40:29–31  
> “The Lord is my strength and my shield...” — Psalm 28:7  
> “Be strong and courageous... the Lord your God is with you.” — Deuteronomy 31:6

> [!info]+ Greek Word Study: \gr{ἐνδυναμόω} (_endunamoō_)  
> **Meaning**: To be made strong, empowered inwardly  
> **Voice**: Passive — strength is received, not self-generated  
> **Used in**: 2 Timothy 2:1 – “Be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.”

> [!info]+ Greek Word Study: \gr{κράτος} (_kratos_)  
> **Meaning**: Dominion, ruling strength. God’s displayed might.  
> **Used in**: Ephesians 1:19, Revelation 1:6

> [!info]+ Greek Word Study: \gr{ἰσχύς} (_ischus_)  
> **Meaning**: Strength in action—power that accomplishes what God wills

> “For the weapons of our warfare are not of the flesh, but divinely powerful for the destruction of fortresses...” — 2 Corinthians 10:4  
> “I can do all things through Him who strengthens me.” — Philippians 4:13  
> “God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power and love and discipline.” — 2 Timothy 1:7

### B. Put On the Whole Armor of God

> “Put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh...” — Romans 13:14  
> “Lay aside the deeds of darkness and put on the armor of light.” — Romans 13:12  
> “He put on righteousness like a breastplate...” — Isaiah 59:17

No soldier walks into battle unarmed. Putting on the armor is a **spiritual mindset** and a **daily decision**.

> “Every word of God is tested; He is a shield to those who take refuge in Him.” — Proverbs 30:5  
> “Your word I have treasured in my heart, that I may not sin against You.” — Psalm 119:11  
> “Blessed be the Lord, my rock, who trains my hands for war...” — Psalm 144:1

---

## II. The Enemy: The Devil and His Schemes

> “Be of sober spirit, be on the alert. Your adversary, the devil, prowls around like a roaring lion...” — 1 Peter 5:8  
> “The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy...” — John 10:10  
> “Satan disguises himself as an angel of light.” — 2 Corinthians 11:14  
> “Do not give the devil an opportunity.” — Ephesians 4:27

> [!info]+ Greek Word Study: \gr{μεθοδεία} (_methodeia_)  
> **Meaning**: Schemes, craftiness, ambush tactics. Military term for strategic deception.

He attacks by:

- Twisting God’s Word (Genesis 3:1)
    
- Promoting pride and division (1 Corinthians 1:10)
    
- Normalizing sin (Isaiah 5:20)
    
- Discouraging the faithful (Job 1–2)
    

> “Submit therefore to God. Resist the devil and he will flee from you.” — James 4:7  
> “The Lord will rescue me from every evil deed...” — 2 Timothy 4:18

---

## III. The Nature of the Warfare

> “For our struggle is not against flesh and blood...” — Ephesians 6:12

> [!info]+ Greek Word Study: \gr{πάλη} (_palē_)  
> **Meaning**: Wrestling—intimate, exhausting hand-to-hand combat

The battle is personal. It's not about politics, culture, or nation. It's spiritual, and it is real.

> “Though we walk in the flesh, we do not war according to the flesh...” — 2 Corinthians 10:3  
> “The mind set on the flesh is death...” — Romans 8:6

### The Enemy’s Forces:

- **Principalities** (\gr{ἀρχαί}) – Rulers of rebellion
    
- **Powers** (\gr{ἐξουσίαι}) – Delegated authorities
    
- **World rulers of darkness** (\gr{κοσμοκράτορες}) – Spiritual influence through corruption
    
- **Spiritual wickedness** (\gr{πνευματικά πονηρίας}) – Unseen demonic opposition
    

> “Greater is He who is in you than he who is in the world.” — 1 John 4:4  
> “No weapon that is formed against you will prosper...” — Isaiah 54:17  
> “He disarmed the rulers and authorities...” — Colossians 2:15

We don’t fight **for** victory. We fight **from** it.

## IV. The Duty: Take Up the Whole Armor of God

> “Therefore, take up the full armor of God, so that you will be able to resist in the evil day, and having done everything, to stand firm.” — Ephesians 6:13

### The Evil Day

This “evil day” is any day in which temptation, trial, or demonic opposition increases. It may come through persecution, false teaching, personal suffering, or emotional despair.

> “But realize this, that in the last days difficult times will come.” — 2 Timothy 3:1  
> “Because lawlessness is increased, most people’s love will grow cold.” — Matthew 24:12  
> “The prudent sees the evil and hides himself...” — Proverbs 27:12

### The Command: Take It Up

> "Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good." — Romans 12:21  
> "Discipline yourself for the purpose of godliness." — 1 Timothy 4:7  
> "Be on the alert, stand firm in the faith, act like men, be strong." — 1 Corinthians 16:13
