# Faithfulness in Marriage

**Scripture:** Hebrews 13:4; Ephesians 5:31–33

## Introduction:

Marriage is sacred — not invented by man, but designed by God. In a culture that treats vows casually, the church must stand firm.

## Thesis:

Strong families begin with faithful marriages. If we want a strong church, it starts in our homes.

## Main Points:

1. **Marriage is Honor-Assigned** (Hebrews 13:4)  
   → God esteems it highly; do we?

2. **Faithfulness Mirrors Christ** (Ephesians 5:31–33)  
   → The way a husband loves, the way a wife respects — reflects the gospel.

3. **Marriage Needs Maintenance**  
   → We don’t drift into deeper love. We drive there.

## Conclusion:

Your marriage isn’t just personal — it’s spiritual. It either reinforces or contradicts the message of Christ.

## Application:

- Pray with your spouse this week
- Confess where you’ve been passive
- Teach your children what covenant love looks like

## Takeaway:

> “Faithful marriages build a faithful church.”
