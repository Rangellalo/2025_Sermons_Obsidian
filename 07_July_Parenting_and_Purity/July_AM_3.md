# Persevering Through Trials

**Scripture:** James 1:2–4; Romans 5:3–5

## Introduction:

Trials are not interruptions. They’re invitations to grow. Faith isn’t proven in the good days — it’s revealed in the hard ones.

## Thesis:

Strong families learn to endure together, not escape separately.

## Main Points:

1. **Count It All Joy** (James 1:2–3)  
   → Our attitude toward trials shapes our outcome from them.

2. **Endurance Produces Character** (Rom 5:3–4)  
   → Pressure doesn’t destroy faith — it refines it.

3. **Let Endurance Finish Its Work** (James 1:4)  
   → Don’t quit mid-process. God’s not done yet.

## Conclusion:

The storms you go through together can either divide or deepen your bond.

## Application:

- Talk openly about struggles as a family
- Encourage resilience and prayer, not panic
- Thank God for what He’s doing — even in the pain

## Takeaway:

> “Suffering isn’t a detour — it’s discipleship.”
