# Raising Faithful Children

**Scripture:** Deuteronomy 6:4–9; 2 Timothy 1:5

## Introduction:

You don’t raise faithful kids by accident. You raise them on purpose — by daily investment, not wishful thinking.

## Thesis:

Raising children to love the Lord is the family’s first mission.

## Main Points:

1. **Teach Diligently** (Deut 6:7)  
   → Faith is formed in moments and modeled in everyday life.

2. **Live It Yourself**  
   → Lois and Eunice didn’t just instruct — they lived it (2 Tim 1:5).

3. **Discipline in Love**  
   → Kids need correction that reflects God’s justice and grace.

## Conclusion:

Faith isn’t inherited. It’s transferred through example, instruction, and love.

## Application:

- Build a regular habit of family prayer or Bible reading
- Speak God’s Word in natural conversations
- Parent with the end in mind — eternity

## Takeaway:

> “Faithful homes don’t happen by default. They happen by devotion.”
