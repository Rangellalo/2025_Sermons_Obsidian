# Leaving a Legacy of Faith

**Scripture:** Psalm 78:4–7; Proverbs 13:22

## Introduction:

What story are you writing with your life? What will your children say mattered most to you?

## Thesis:

A faithful family leaves spiritual fingerprints on the next generation.

## Main Points:

1. **Tell the Next Generation** (Ps 78:4)  
   → Don’t assume they’ll know — speak it, show it, live it.

2. **Hope in God, Not in Stuff**  
   → Inheritance isn’t just money — it’s mission, mindset, and meaning.

3. **Faith is Your Real Estate**  
   → More valuable than land or cash is a well-taught child of God.

## Conclusion:

You’re building your family’s future — one decision, one conversation at a time.

## Application:

- Share your conversion story with your kids
- Pass down a well-used Bible
- Invest in spiritual conversations more than material wealth

## Takeaway:

> “The greatest legacy is faith that outlives you.”
