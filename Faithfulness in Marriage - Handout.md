# Faithfulness in Marriage—A Foundation for Church Stability

**Text:** Hebrews 13:4; Ephesians 5:31–33

## Introduction
- Faithful marriages strengthen families and the church.

## I. Marriage Is Honorable (Heb 13:4)
- Marriage is God’s design, not man’s.
- “Honor” (τίμιος): marriage is precious and valuable.
- Faithfulness is required: physically (Heb 13:4; 1 Cor 7:2–5), emotionally (Eph 5:28–29; Prov 5:18–19), and spiritually (Eph 5:31–32).
- Marriage is a covenant to be protected and esteemed.

## II. The Mystery of Oneness (Eph 5:31–32)
- Marriage forms a new, primary allegiance.
- “Leave” (καταλείψει) and “be joined” (προσκολληθήσεται): lifelong union.
- “One flesh” means full unity—body, mind, and spirit.
- Marriage pictures Christ’s union with the church.

## III. Faithfulness as Witness
- Faithful marriages show God’s faithfulness in a world of broken promises.
- Christian marriage models Christ’s love and commitment.
- The church’s credibility is strengthened by strong marriages.

## IV. Strengthening Marriages, Strengthening the Church
- Strong marriages build a strong church.
- Practical: pray, study, communicate, seek help when needed.
- The church should encourage and support couples (Titus 2:3–5).

## Conclusion
- Honor marriage and pursue faithfulness.
- Faithful marriages build a faithful church and point to Christ.
